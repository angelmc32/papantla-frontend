## Description

**If your flight is cancelled, we pay you immediately. Papantla: Insurance without intermediaries...**  

Currently, flight insurance is a necessity for anyone who wishes to travel with peace of mind. However, traditional processes for purchasing and managing flight insurance are often complex, expensive, and lack transparency. That is why we create Papantla.

At Papantla, we believe that blockchain technology can also improve the efficiency of the claims process. Our platform allows users to submit and track their claims quickly and easily, thanks to the traceability and transparency provided by blockchain technology.

With our innovative approach and utilization of cutting-edge technology, Papantla has created a platform for selling flight insurance that is safer, more efficient, and more transparent than any other traditional flight insurance provider. Rest easy on your next trip with Papantla.
